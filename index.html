    <p>
      An online record of my favorite movies. A place where I have added short lists of 
      some of my favorites from genres that I watch the most. Each list has a mixture
      of movies that I either enjoy due to its artistry or because of it's enjoyability.
      Although some of the movies in these lists arent my all time favorites, they are still
      movies I appreciate.
